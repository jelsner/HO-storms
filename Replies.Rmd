1\. Yes, Equation (3) in the paper defines a model where the left-hand
side is expressed as cloglog($\pi$), which is the complementary log-log
transformation of $\pi$. This transformation is used because th
probability $\pi$ is modeled as a function of covariates.

If you are obtaining values of $r$ similar to those in Figure 3 by
considering the left-hand side of Eq (3) as $\pi$ rather than
cloglog($\pi$), it suggests a possible misinterpretation. The correct
interpretation should involve taking the inverse of the complementary
log-log function to retrieve $\pi$ from the regression output. This
means: $$
\pi = 1 âˆ’ \exp(-\exp(\alpha_0 + \alpha_1 SOI + \alpha_2 NAO)) 
$$

You should apply the inverse cloglog transformation to correctly
interpret the predicted probabilities.

2\. Yes, the binomial parameter $p$ can be calculated using the
equation: $$ 
    \lambda = r(1 + p)
    $$

where: $\lambda$ is the expected annual hurricane frequency, $r$ is the
expected annual cluster rate, $p$ represents the probability that a
cluster contains two hurricanes rather than just one.

Implication for $p$. If both $\lambda$ and $r$ are functions of climate
covariates (e.g., NAO and SOI), then $p$ is also dependent on these
covariates: $$
p = \frac{\lambda}{r} - 1
$$

This equation suggests that $p$ is not necessarily constant. Instead, it
varies with the ratio of hurricane frequency to cluster rate, which
could change depending on environmental conditions. We also mention that
by comparing the coefficients in Equations (4) and (5), a regression
model for $p$ can be derived, further supporting the idea that $p$ is
influenced by covariates. If you assume that $p$ is constant, you might
be oversimplifying the clustering behavior of hurricanes. Instead,
modeling $p$ as a function of climate variables could provide a more
accurate representation of hurricane occurrence patterns.

3\. You're on the right track in considering $P(H=0|r,p)$. In the
cluster model, the total number of hurricanes in a given year is given
by: $$
H = N + M
$$ where: $N \sim$ Poisson($r$) and where $M \sim$ Binomial($N, p$) is
the number of extra hurricanes from a cluster of size 2.

For the special case $k=0$ (i.e., no hurricanes in a year), this means
there must be no clusters at all. That is, $N = 0$, because if at least
one cluster existed, there would be at least one hurricane.

Since $N$ follows a Poisson distribution, the probability of no clusters
occurring is: $$
P(N=0|r) = \frac{e^{-r} r^0}{0!} = e^{-r}
$$ Thus, the probability that there are no hurricanes in a given year
is: $$
P(H=0|r,p) = P(N=0) = e^{-r}
$$

Which matches your intuition! The expression involving $k-i$ and $i$
does not apply in this case because there are no terms to sum with
$N=0$. The binomial part of the model (which governs cluster sizes) only
comes into play when at least one cluster is present.

So, in summary, your initial thought was correct: $$
P(H=0|r, p) = e^{-r}
$$

The undefined expression issue does not arise because the summation
formula is only used for $k \gt 0$ while for $k=0$ we directly use the
Poisson probability of zero clusters.

4\. Here is the approach for generating estimated annual hurricane
counts for $X$ years using the cluster model.

Step 1: Since the number of clusters per year, $N$ follows a Poisson
distribution with rate $r$ $N \sim$ Poisson($r$). For each year,
generate a random draw from this Poisson distribution to determine the
number of clusters that occur in that year.

Step 2: Each cluster contains either one or two hurricanes, governed by
a Binomial process $M \sim$ Binomial($N$, $p$) where $N$ is the number
of clusters from step 1 and $M$ is the number of additional hurricanes
from clusters that contain two hurricanes (each cluster contributes at
least one hurricane, and an additional one with probability $p$).

Step 3: Then the total number of hurricanes in a given year is
$H = N + M$

Step 4: Repeat for $X$ number of years
